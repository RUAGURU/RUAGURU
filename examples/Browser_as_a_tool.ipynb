        "The previous command failed because the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable was not set in the current notebook environment, causing the `genai.Client` initialization to fail. Since the goal is to create the deployment files, this error is expected in the notebook but must be handled gracefully in the deployable code. The current `main.py` code already includes a check for the environment variable and prints an error, but the `genai.Client` initialization still proceeds and fails. The fix is to only initialize the client if the API key is available or handle the missing key later. However, the `browse_url` function also failed because `ChromeDriverManager().install()` needs to be called within a function to be executed dynamically, and potentially requires a working internet connection and headless browser setup which are not present in the notebook environment. The traceback shows `ChromeDriverManager().install()` is being called immediately when the script is evaluated, before any request is received. This should be moved inside the `browse_url` function. Let's regenerate the `main.py` code with these adjustments and proceed with creating the `requirements.txt` file.\n",

        "*   The initial notebook code contained a `SecretNotFoundError` because the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` was being accessed using `userdata.get`, which is specific to the Colab environment, not a standard deployment environment.\n",
        "*   The `browse_url` tool has significant dependencies, requiring `selenium`, `webdriver-manager`, and a headless Chromium browser executable to be installed in the deployment environment.\n",
        "*   The `browse_url` function's saving of a screenshot to a local file (`screenshot.png`) is not suitable for a stateless environment like Cloud Run, as the file will not persist between requests.\n",
        "*   The intranet simulation code present in the original notebook is generally not needed for a standard Cloud Run deployment focused on external browsing and would typically be excluded.\n",
        "*   Attempting to initialize the `genai.Client` and tool declarations at the script level in the deployment code led to errors (`ValueError` and `AttributeError`) when the API key environment variable was not set during script loading.\n",
        "*   Generating the necessary deployment files (`main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`) was successful after addressing the issues with API key access and tool declaration timing.\n",
        "*   Building the Docker image and deploying to Cloud Run requires executing `gcloud` commands externally, as these cannot be run directly within the notebook environment.\n",
        "*   Verifying the deployed application requires sending external requests to the Cloud Run service URL and examining logs, which also cannot be fully automated within the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The `browse_url` function needs modification to handle screenshot storage persistently (e.g., uploading to Cloud Storage) if the screenshot needs to be available for subsequent requests or container instances.\n",
        "*   The `genai.Client` and tool declarations should be initialized within the request handling logic (e.g., inside the Flask route) to ensure the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is available from the environment when needed and to avoid errors during script startup.\n",
        "*   The user needs to manually execute the generated `gcloud builds submit` and `gcloud run deploy` commands in their terminal, replacing placeholder values, and configure the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in Google Cloud Secret Manager and link it to the Cloud Run service.\n"
